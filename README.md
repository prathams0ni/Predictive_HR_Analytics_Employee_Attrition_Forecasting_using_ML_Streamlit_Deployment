## 🚀 Project Overview

Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations as it increases hiring cost, affects productivity, and disrupts workforce stability. This project applies Machine Learning to analyze employee performance and behavioral data to forecast attrition risk.

The solution is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application**, allowing real-time prediction based on employee input features. This makes the system practical for HR departments to identify employees who are likely to leave and take preventive actions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict whether an employee will **Leave or Stay**
- Help HR identify high-risk employees early
- Enable data-driven workforce retention strategies
- Build and deploy an end-to-end ML web application
- Demonstrate real-world HR analytics use-case

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**  
   HR Employee dataset containing performance and behavioral attributes.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling categorical variables using Label Encoding  
   - Data cleaning and feature preparation  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   Selected key HR indicators influencing employee attrition.

4. **Model Training**  
   Decision Tree Classifier trained for classification.

5. **Model Serialization**  
   Saved trained model using Joblib (`model.pkl`) and encoders (`label_encoders.pkl`).

6. **Deployment**  
   Built an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithm

**Decision Tree Classifier**

The Decision Tree algorithm is a supervised learning model used for classification tasks. It splits the dataset based on feature values to predict whether an employee is likely to leave.

**Why Decision Tree?**
- Handles non-linear relationships well  
- Easy to interpret  
- Works well with structured HR data  
- Requires minimal feature scaling  

---

## 📊 Input Features

The model predicts attrition based on the following employee attributes:

- Satisfaction Level  
- Last Evaluation Score  
- Number of Projects  
- Average Monthly Hours  
- Years in Company  
- Promotion in Last 5 Years  
- Department  
- Salary Level  

---

## 📌 Output

- Predicts whether employee is **Likely to Quit** or **Not Likely to Quit**
- Helps HR identify attrition risk for proactive retention planning
